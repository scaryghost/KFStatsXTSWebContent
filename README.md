KFStatsXTSWebContent
====================

Provides the web content for the KFSXTrackingServer.  These files were originally part of the KFSXTrackingServer 
project but I wanted to separate the web code from the core data processing functionality.  

##Install
The KFSXTrackingServer project has this web content project loaded as a submodule.  By default, the build will copy 
the files from the commit hash that is associated with the KFSXTrackingServer build.

If you desire to use a different version than the one bundled in the download, simply replace the http folder in the 
dist direction of the KFSXTrackingServer download with the http folder from this project.
